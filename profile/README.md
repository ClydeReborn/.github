## Want to try it out?
You can clone our repositories to try it out. We also have a deployed account [here*](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=900004137742262332&scope=bot+applications.commands), feel free to add it to your server for a bit of AI-driven fun.

## NEW
We now use Gemini! This means:
- The model follows instructions better
- No more ching-chong is in the output
- You can send image inputs
- Clyde is more stable

*<sup><sub>Due to Discord Terms of Service, it is not named Clyde, the behavior remains the same.</sup></sub>
